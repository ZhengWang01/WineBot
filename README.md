## Motivations

According to an on-line survey, 44% of U.S. consumers prefer chat-bots to humans when it comes to customer relations. More than 80% of company is utilizing chatbot in 2020. Chatbot offer a multitude of benefits for both the customer and company. It increases customers satisfaction and generated more revenue for companies.

## Overview of the Project

In this project, I utilized the [Rasa](https://rasa.com/) open source chatbot. I trained Latent Sentiment Analysis models that takes the preprocessed customer query, and give corresponding recommendation based on what the customer need.

The deliverable of the project is a Web App that allows user to tell the chatbot what they need, and get the recommendation on which wine they should buy.
